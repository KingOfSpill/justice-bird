## Vision Statement
  
  We are living in a time of history where it seems like every time you hear about the news, you get ready for something disappointing,
  enraging, frightening, and sometimes all three. So for those who need a break from the chaos we now call news we have released
  Justice Pigeon, a game which allows you to fly across various terrains as a bird while also avoiding obstacles and gaining points
  along the way. The best part of our game however is the ability to defecate on the heads of those who you are tired of seeing on the
  news every single week. On the contrary of what you may be thinking, our birds are bipartisan so everybody has an equal oppurtunity to
  get pooped on, no matter their political views. Our game is a fun way to unwind and can even provide a method of relief from the daily
  news. This supports our company’s strategy to release games which are not only exciting but also relevant to the current times.
