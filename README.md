## Vision Statement

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are living in a time of history where it seems like every time you hear about the news, you get ready for something disappointing, enraging, frightening, and sometimes even all three. So for those who need a break from the chaos we now call news, we have released Justice Pigeon! A game which allows you to fly as a bird across various terrains while also avoiding obstacles and gaining points along the way. What makes our game different from your typical maze runner, is the ability to use your bird ability to defecate on the heads of those who you are tired of seeing on the news every single week. On the contrary of what you might just be thinking, our birds are bipartisan; so everybody has an equal oppurtunity to get pooped on, no matter their political views. Our game is a fun way to unwind and can even provide a method of relief from the daily news. This supports our companyâ€™s strategy to release games which are not only exciting but also relevant to the current times.
